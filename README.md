### Dashboard View

- Displays a list of all departments with their respective names and employee counts  
  - If there are employees not assigned to any department, a department named “Unassigned” should be displayed with the corresponding employee count  
- Clicking a department navigates to the department view  
- Provides functionality to add new departments and delete existing ones  
  - Editing existing departments is not required via the frontend  
  - Deleting an existing department moves all previously assigned employees to the "Unassigned" department

  - Choosing a different template or using Spring Boot will **not** negatively impact your submission in any way  
- We appreciate efforts toward designing a performant and thoughtful solution.However, we don't want you to dedicate crazy hours - keep it simple, but clean. 
- Upon completion, please share access to your project repository (e.g., via a GitHub link)  
- During the interview, we will conduct a code-review-style discussion of your solution. Be prepared to explain your design choices and the concepts you applied  

### Backend

- Even though the frontend does not require editing existing departments or employees, the backend **should** support updating these entities  
- Comprehensive testing is not required; however, please include some basic tests for selected components as representative examples  

### Frontend

- The provided UI mockups are examples only. You may follow them or create your own layout, as long as the functional requirements are met
